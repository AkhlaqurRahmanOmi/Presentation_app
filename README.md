## Presentation App Backend

This repository contains the backend code for the **Presentation App**, built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**. The backend serves as the core engine, handling all the server-side logic, API endpoints, and data management required for the Presentation App. It is designed to provide a reliable, secure, and scalable foundation for the application, ensuring smooth operation and seamless communication between the client-side and the database.

### Key Features:

- **RESTful API Development:**
  - The backend exposes a set of RESTful API endpoints that facilitate operations such as slide creation, updating, retrieval, and deletion.
  - These APIs are designed to be robust, handling various edge cases and providing appropriate responses to ensure a seamless user experience.

- **Database Management:**
  - The backend integrates with a **MongoDB** database, providing efficient data storage and retrieval for user-generated content, such as presentation slides, user profiles, and session data.
  - Data schemas are well-structured to support the appâ€™s features, with a focus on scalability and performance.

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - The backend implements secure user authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) is also in place, allowing for different levels of permissions depending on user roles (e.g., admin, presenter, viewer).

- **Real-Time Collaboration (Optional Feature):**
  - For enhanced collaboration, the backend supports real-time updates using **Socket.IO**, allowing multiple users to work on the same presentation simultaneously with live updates.
  
- **Error Handling and Logging:**
  - Comprehensive error handling mechanisms are in place to capture and log errors, providing detailed insights for debugging and ensuring the backend runs smoothly even under high load conditions.

- **Scalability and Performance:**
  - The backend is designed with scalability in mind, using techniques like load balancing and optimized query handling to ensure that the app can handle a growing number of users without performance degradation.

This backend forms the backbone of the Presentation App, enabling a robust and efficient system for managing presentation content and user interactions.
